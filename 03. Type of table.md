# Types of table in Hive
In Apache Hive, there are two types of tables:

## Managed Tables:
- Managed tables are the default table type in Hive. 
- Data of table will be stored in warehouse directory inside HDFS configured for Hive.
- The data and metadata of a managed table are managed by Hive. 
- By managed we mean that if you drop the table, then Hive will delete both the Schema and the data files associated with the table.
- The following is an example of a managed table:
```
CREATE TABLE employee
(
  emp_id INT,
  emp_name STRING,
  emp_dept STRING
)
```

## External Tables:
- External tables are used to access data that is not managed by Hive. 
- Data of table will not be stored in warehouse directory inside HDFS configured for Hive. It will be at HDFS location.
- It is like external reference to the raw data.
- The data and metadata of an external table are not managed by Hive. 
- When a table is deleted, Hive will only delete the schema associated with the table. The data files are not affected.
- The following is an example of an external table:
```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employee_ext
(
  emp_id INT,
  emp_name STRING,
  emp_dept STRING
)
LOCATION '/path_to_HDFS_data_directory/';
```

# Difference

| Managed Table | External Table |
|---------------|----------------|
| Hive assumes it owns the data | Hive assumes it does not manage the data |
| Deletes data and metadata associated with table or partition | Deletes metadata for table, but not data |
| Stored in Hive's warehouse directory | Stored in the specified LOCATION, generally not in warehouse directory |
| Managed table provides ACID/transnational action support | External Table does not provide ACID/transactional action support |
| Statements: ARCHIVE, UNARCHIVE, TRUNCATE, MERGE, CONCATENATE supported | Not supported |
| Query Result Caching supported(saves the results of an executed Hive query for reuse) | Not supported |
