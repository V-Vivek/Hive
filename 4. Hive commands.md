# Hive commands

## Create Managed table
```
CREATE TABLE employee
(
  emp_id INT,
  emp_name STRING,
  emp_dept STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
```
#### FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' clause 
- It specifies that each field in the data is separated by a comma (',') character. 
- This is a common format for data that is stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.

#### ROW FORMAT DELIMITED clause
- It specifies that each row in the data is separated by a delimiter character, which is specified by the "FIELDS TERMINATED BY" or "LINES TERMINATED BY" clauses. 
- If these clauses are not specified, Hive uses default delimiters ('\n' for lines and '\t' for fields).

## Load data from local
```
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'file://path_to_data_directory/data.csv' INTO TABLE table_name;
```

## Display column name
```
SET hive.cli.print.header = true;
```

## Load data from HDFS
```
LOAD DATA INPATH '/path_to_HDFS_data_directory/data.csv' INTO TABLE table_name;
```

## Create External table
- Note that we need to specify the location of data while creating the table itself.
- Hence, no need to load the data manually.
- Also note that in LOCATION we have specified the directory path instead of file name. So that if there are multiple files in that directory with same schema all of them will be loaded in the table.
- Also in future if new filesa re added in that directory they will also be auto loaded in the table.
- But make sure that the schema of all the data files in the directory should match with the schema of table.
```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employee
(
  emp_id INT,
  emp_name STRING,
  emp_dept STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LOCATION '/path_to_HDFS_data_directory/';
```
