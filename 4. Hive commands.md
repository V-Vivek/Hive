# Hive commands

## Create Managed table
```
CREATE TABLE employee (
  emp_id INT,
  emp_name STRING,
  emp_dept STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
```
#### FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' clause 
- It specifies that each field in the data is separated by a comma (',') character. 
- This is a common format for data that is stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.

#### ROW FORMAT DELIMITED clause
- It specifies that each row in the data is separated by a delimiter character, which is specified by the "FIELDS TERMINATED BY" or "LINES TERMINATED BY" clauses. 
- If these clauses are not specified, Hive uses default delimiters ('\n' for lines and '\t' for fields).
