# LATERAL VIEW
- In Hive, a LATERAL VIEW is used in conjunction with a table-generating function, such as explode(), to transform a single row into multiple rows, based on the output of the table-generating function.

## Syntax: 
```
LATERAL VIEW table_generating_function(expression) table_alias AS column_alias1, column_alias2, ...
```

- Here, table_generating_function is a function that generates a table or a set of rows, and expression is the expression or column on which the function is applied. 
- table_alias is the alias assigned to the generated table, and column_alias1, column_alias2, etc. are the aliases assigned to the columns of the generated table.

# Inserting Data into a table using explode() & LATERAL VIEW
- To save the table created from a LATERAL VIEW, you can use the INSERT INTO statement, which inserts the output of a SELECT query into a table.

## Existing 'fruits' table
```
CREATE TABLE fruits
(
  basket_id INT,
  fruit_count MAP<STRING, INT>
);

INSERT INTO TABLE fruits
SELECT 1, map("apple", 2, "banana", 3, "orange", 1),
SELECT 2, map("apple", 1, "banana", 2, "mango", 2),
SELECT 3, map("orange", 5, "papaya", 3, "kiwi", 2);
```
| basket_id | fruit_count                         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1               | {"apple":2,"banana":3,"orange":1}          |
| 2               | {"apple":1,"banana":2,"mango":2}           |
| 3               | {"orange":5,"papaya":3,"kiwi":2}           |


### Creating schema for new table
```
CREATE TABLE fruit_counts
(
  basket_id INT,
  fruit_name STRING,
  count INT
);
```
### Inserting data in new table using explode() & LATERAL VIEW
```
INSERT INTO fruit_counts 
SELECT basket_id, exploded_fruit, count FROM fruits
LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(fruit_count) exploded_table AS exploded_fruit, count;
```
- This will create a new table fruit_counts with three columns basket_id, fruit_name, and count, and insert the output of the SELECT query into it. 
- The SELECT query uses the LATERAL VIEW clause with EXPLODE() to transform the fruit_count column into a table with two columns exploded_fruit and count, and select those columns along with the basket_id column from the fruits table.
- The resulting fruit_counts table will have one row for each fruit count in the fruits table, with the basket_id indicating the basket from which the count was obtained.
- Note that the schema of the new table fruit_counts should match the schema of the output of the SELECT query.

## Output
| basket_id | fruit_name | count |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| 1                     | apple                  | 2                  |
| 1                     | banana                 | 3                  |
| 1                     | orange                 | 1                  |
| 2                     | apple                  | 1                  |
| 2                     | banana                 | 2                  |
| 2                     | mango                  | 2                  |
| 3                     | orange                 | 5                  |
| 3                     | papaya                 | 3                  |
| 3                     | kiwi                   | 2                  |
