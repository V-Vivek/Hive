# Partitioning
- Partitioning in Hive is a technique used to improve the performance of queries on large datasets by dividing them into smaller, more manageable parts. 
- Hive supports several types of partitioning, which are:

## Static Partitioning
- Here value of partition column(s) will be known to us.
- We load the data in specific partitions.
- Static partitioning takes less time while loading the data.

# Example
## Create table
```
CREATE TABLE sales
(
  date STRING,
  region STRING,
  product STRING,
  sales INT
)
PARTITIONED BY (date STRING, region STRING);
```
## Insert Data
```
INSERT INTO TABLE sales PARTITION (date='2022-01-01', region='East')
VALUES ('2022-01-01', 'East', 'Product A', 100),
       ('2022-01-01', 'East', 'Product B', 200);
```
```
INSERT INTO TABLE sales PARTITION (date='2022-01-02', region='West')
VALUES ('2022-01-02', 'West', 'Product A', 150),
       ('2022-01-02', 'West', 'Product B', 250);
```
- In this example, we created a table called sales and partitioned it by date and region columns. 
- We then inserted data into the table using the INSERT INTO TABLE command, specifying the partition values for each row


## Dynamic Partitioning
- Here column values will be unknown.
- Hive will identify the unique values from partition column(s).
- It takes longer time for loading the data.
