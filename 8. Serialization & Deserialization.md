# Serialization
- Serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be stored or transmitted across a network.
- Serialization allows data to be saved in a file or database, sent over a network or stored in memory. 

## Example
- Suppose you have an object in your program that contains several fields, including a name and an age. 
- To serialize this object, you would convert it into a string or byte array that can be stored or transmitted. 
- This might involve converting the name field into a string and the age field into an integer. 
- Once the object is serialized, it can be saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in memory.

# Deserialization
- Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization. 
- The opposite process, converting serialized data back into an object or data structure is called deserialization.
- It involves taking a string or byte array that represents serialized data and converting it back into an object or data structure. 

## Example
- In the example above, deserialization would involve taking the serialized string or byte array and converting it back into an object with fields for name and age.

# SerDe in Hive
- In Hive, the ROW FORMAT and STORED AS properties are used to define how data is stored and read from a table. 
- These properties are part of the SerDe properties and play an important role in defining the structure of the data in a Hive table.

## ROW FORMAT
- The ROW FORMAT property is used to define the structure of the data stored in a Hive table. 
- It describes the libraries used to convert a given row into column object.
- This includes the field delimiter used to separate fields in the data, the line delimiter used to separate rows and any special characters used to enclose fields. 
- By default, Hive assumes that data is stored in text format, with fields separated by tabs and rows separated by newlines. 
- However, the Row Format property can be used to specify different delimiters and formats, such as CSV, JSON or custom delimiters.

## STORED AS
- The STORED AS property is used to specify the file format used to store the data in a Hive table. 
- It describes the input format & output format libraries used by Map-Reduce to Read & Write to HDFS.
- Hive supports several file formats, including text, sequence file, ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) and Parquet. 
- Each file format has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of storage space, query performance and data compression. 
- For example, ORC and Parquet are optimized for columnar storage, which can improve query performance for certain types of queries.
