- Schema on read and schema on write are two different approaches to handling data in big data systems.

# Schema on write(RDBMS)
- Schema on write refers to the traditional approach of defining a schema for data before writing it to a storage system. 
- In this approach, the schema defines the structure of the data, including the data types of each field. 
- When new data is written to the storage system, it must conform to the schema. 
- This approach is used by traditional relational databases and many other storage systems that require strict schema enforcement.

## Example
```
CREATE TABLE my_table
(
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  age INT
);
```
- When we insert new data into this table, we must ensure that the data matches the schema.

```
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (2, 'Bob', 30);
```
- In schema on write, the schema must be defined before data can be written and any changes to the schema require rewriting all the data.
- The data will be validated with schema before inserting. Below insertion will through error as it is not matching with schema.
```
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES ('Bob', 2, 30);
```

# Schema on read(Hive)
- Schema on read, on the other hand, refers to an approach where the schema is only defined when the data is read. 
- This approach allows for more flexibility in the data format and structure, as the schema can be changed or evolved over time without having to rewrite all the data.

## Example
```
CREATE TABLE my_table
(
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  age INT
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
```
- When we query this table, Hive will read the JSON data and map the fields to the columns in the table based on the schema we defined. 
- If the data changes or evolves over time, we can simply update the schema to match the new data format.
- Schema on read is often used in big data systems where data is stored in different formats and structures and where it's not always practical or feasible to define a strict schema before data is written. 
- It allows for more flexibility and agility in data processing and analysis.
- The below query will not raise any error while inserting.
```
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES ('Bob', 2, 30);
```
- But when we try to read the data using ```SELECT```it will validate it with the schema & raise error on read operation.
