# Map Join (Broadcast Join)
- It is a join optimization technique used in Hive to improve the performance of join queries. 
- This technique is particularly useful when one of the tables involved in the join operation is ***small enough to fit in memory***.
- In a map join, the small table is loaded into memory and then broadcast to all the nodes in the cluster. 
- The larger table is then streamed through and the join is performed in memory. 
- This ***avoids the need to shuffle and sort*** the data, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
- To use map join, first enable it in Hive by setting the "hive.auto.convert.join" property to "true":
```
SET hive.auto.convert.join = true;
```

## Example

- Employee Table  

| employee_id | name      | department_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 1           | John Doe  | 1             | 50000  |
| 2           | Jane Doe  | 1             | 60000  |
| 3           | Bob Smith | 2             | 55000  |
| 4           | Mary Lee  | 2             | 65000  |
| 5           | Tom Jones | 3             | 70000  |

- Department Table

| department_id | name      |
|---------------|-----------|
| 1             | Sales     |
| 2             | Marketing |
| 3             | Finance   |

- Query
```
SET hive.auto.convert.join = true;
```
```
SELECT e.name, d.name as department_name
FROM employee e
JOIN department d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

# Bucket Map Join
- When all the tables are large and all the tables used in the join are ***bucketed on the join columns*** we use a Bucket Map Join.
- Only the required buckets are fetched on the mapper side and not the complete table.
- Hence, onto each mapper, only the matching buckets of all small tables are replicated. 
- As a result of this, the efficiency of the query improves drastically.
- We need to set the following property  to true for the query to work as this join:
```
SET hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin = true;
```
## Conditions for Bucket Map Join
- Tables are bigger in size
- All the tables are bucketed on the same join columns
- The number of buckets in one table is a multiple of the number of buckets in the other table

## Example
- Sales table  

| sale_id | customer_id | sale_amount |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1       | 1001        | 100.00      |
| 2       | 1002        | 200.00      |
| 3       | 1003        | 300.00      |
| 4       | 1001        | 150.00      |
| 5       | 1003        | 250.00      |

- Customers table  

| customer_id | customer_name    | customer_address  |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1001        | John Doe         | 123 Main St       |
| 1002        | Jane Smith       | 456 Oak Ave       |
| 1003        | Bob Johnson      | 789 Elm St        |
| 1004        | Mary Williams   | 111 Pine St        |

- Query
```
SET hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin = true;
```
```
SELECT s.sale_id, c.customer_name, s.sale_amount
FROM sales s
JOIN customers c
ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

# Sorted Merge Join
- It is called a "sorted" merge join because both datasets must be sorted on the join key column before the join can take place. 
- Here's an overview of how it works:
### Sort both datasets: 
- The first step in a sorted merge join is to sort both datasets on the join key column. 
- This can be done using the ORDER BY clause in Hive.

### Merge the datasets: 
- Once the datasets are sorted, the join operation can begin. 
- Hive will merge the datasets using a merge algorithm, which compares the values of the join key column in each dataset and combines the matching rows into a single result.

### Output the results: 
- The final step is to output the results of the join operation. 
- The output will contain all of the columns from both datasets, with matching rows combined into a single row.

### Advantage
- One advantage of a sorted merge join in Hive is that it can be much faster than other types of joins when dealing with large datasets, since the sorting step allows Hive to avoid scanning the entire dataset for each join. 

### Disadvantage
- However, the downside is that the datasets must be sorted before the join can take place, which can be time-consuming and may require additional storage space.

FROM sales s
