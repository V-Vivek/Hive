# Map Join (Broadcast Join)
- It is a join optimization technique used in Hive to improve the performance of join queries. 
- This technique is particularly useful when one of the tables involved in the join operation is ***small enough to fit in memory***.
- In a map join, the small table is loaded into memory and then broadcast to all the nodes in the cluster. 
- The larger table is then streamed through and the join is performed in memory. 
- This ***avoids the need to shuffle and sort*** the data, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
- To use map join, first enable it in Hive by setting the "hive.auto.convert.join" property to "true":
```
SET hive.auto.convert.join=true;
```

## Example

- Employee Table  

| employee_id | name      | department_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 1           | John Doe  | 1             | 50000  |
| 2           | Jane Doe  | 1             | 60000  |
| 3           | Bob Smith | 2             | 55000  |
| 4           | Mary Lee  | 2             | 65000  |
| 5           | Tom Jones | 3             | 70000  |

- Department Table

| department_id | name      |
|---------------|-----------|
| 1             | Sales     |
| 2             | Marketing |
| 3             | Finance   |

- Query
```
SET hive.auto.convert.join=true;
```
```
SELECT e.name, d.name as department_name
FROM employee e
JOIN department d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
