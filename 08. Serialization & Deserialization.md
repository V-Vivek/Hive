# Serialization
- Serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be stored or transmitted across a network.
- Serialization allows data to be saved in a file or database, sent over a network or stored in memory. 

## Example
- Suppose you have an object in your program that contains several fields, including a name and an age. 
- To serialize this object, you would convert it into a string or byte array that can be stored or transmitted. 
- This might involve converting the name field into a string and the age field into an integer. 
- Once the object is serialized, it can be saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in memory.

# Deserialization
- Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization. 
- The opposite process, converting serialized data back into an object or data structure is called deserialization.
- It involves taking a string or byte array that represents serialized data and converting it back into an object or data structure. 

## Example
- In the example above, deserialization would involve taking the serialized string or byte array and converting it back into an object with fields for name and age.

# SerDe in Hive
- In Hive, the ROW FORMAT and STORED AS properties are used to define how data is stored and read from a table. 
- These properties are part of the SerDe properties and play an important role in defining the structure of the data in a Hive table.

## ROW FORMAT
- The ROW FORMAT property is used to define the structure of the data stored in a Hive table. 
- It describes the libraries used to convert a given row into column object.
- This includes the field delimiter used to separate fields in the data, the line delimiter used to separate rows and any special characters used to enclose fields. 
- By default, Hive assumes that data is stored in text format, with fields separated by tabs and rows separated by newlines. 
- However, the Row Format property can be used to specify different delimiters and formats, such as CSV, JSON or custom delimiters.

## STORED AS
- The STORED AS property is used to specify the file format used to store the data in a Hive table. 
- It describes the input format & output format libraries used by Map-Reduce to Read & Write to HDFS.
- Hive supports several file formats, including text, sequence file, ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) and Parquet. 
- Each file format has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of storage space, query performance and data compression. 
- For example, ORC and Parquet are optimized for columnar storage, which can improve query performance for certain types of queries.


# SerDe for CSV data
- In Hive, the ```ROW FORMAT SERDE``` clause is used to specify a Serializer/Deserializer (SerDe) for a particular data format.
-  When dealing with CSV data, the SerDe used is typically ```org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde```.

## Sample Data
- Note that we have ',' inside our data. This will confuse the Hive engine and data will be inserted in the table partially.
- For e.g. location for Amit will be inserted as ```"Banglore```
- But we want all the data enclosed inside the "" to be inserted in location column.
- Also note that we have used escape char ```\``` for Vivek because there are ```""``` inside the ```""``` 
```
name,location
Amit,"Bangalore,India"
Shashank,"Gurgaon,India"
Vivek,"Pune,\"Dighi\",India"
```

## Table with SerDe for CSV
- ```"separatorChar" = ","``` - To define that our data is ',' separated
- ```"quoteChar" = "\""``` - To define that we need to insert all data enclosed in double quotes ""  
- ```"escapeChar" = "\\"``` - To define that we are using ```\``` as an escape character. 
```
CREATE TABLE my_table
(
  employee_name STRING,
  employee_location STRING
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
  "separatorChar" = ",",
  "quoteChar" = "\"",
  "escapeChar" = "\\"
)
TBLPROPERTIES  ("skip.header.line.count" = "1")
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
```
- In this example, we're using the OpenCSVSerde SerDe to handle the CSV data format. 
- We also set some SerDe properties to specify the separator character (,), quote character (") and escape character (\) used in the CSV file.
- The STORED AS TEXTFILE clause indicates that the data will be stored in text files in HDFS.

# SerDe for JSON data
- When dealing with JSON data, the SerDe used is typically ```org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe```.

## Sample Data
```
{"name": "Amit", "id": 1, "skills": ["Hadoop", "Python"]}
{"name": "sumit", "id": 2, "skills": ["Hadoop", "Hive"]}
{"name": "Shashank", "id": 3, "skills": ["Airflow", "Python"]}
```

## Table with SerDe for JSON
- Here, no need to specify the SEPARATOR as it is auto identified by the JSON SerDe library.
```
CREATE TABLE my_table 
(
  name STRING,
  id INT,
  skills ARRAY<STRING>
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
```

- The JsonSerDe is capable of handling both JSON objects and arrays. 
- When reading data from JSON files, the SerDe will map the fields in the JSON data to the columns in the Hive table. 
- When writing data to JSON files, the SerDe will generate valid JSON output.
- Note that the JsonSerDe requires that the JSON data is in a specific format. 
- Each JSON object must be on a single line and should not contain any newlines. 
- Additionally, the JSON objects must have the same structure as the table schema.
